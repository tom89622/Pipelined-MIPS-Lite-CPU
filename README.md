# Pipelined-MIPS-Lite-CPU

Pipelined MIPS-Lite CPU is a collaborative project aims to develop a Pipelined MIPS-Lite CPU capable of executing sixteen fundamental instructions, including 'add,' 'or,' 'slt,' 'lw,' 'jr,' 'divu,' 'mfhi,' and 'nop.' To achieve this goal, we implemented a five-stage pipeline comprising Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back stages, as shown in the following figure.
